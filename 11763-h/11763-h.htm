    <h3>DEATH OF REV. JAMES POWELL, D.D.</h3>
    <p>"He whom thou lovest is dead," were the sorrowful words of the stricken sisters
    concerning their brother; we repeat them to our many friends who enjoyed the personal
    friendship of our beloved brother Powell. These friends cannot restore him to us, as
    <i>the</i> Friend restored Lazarus to his family; but they can sympathize with us in
    our great bereavement. It is scarcely three months since our honored president, Gov.
    Washburn, was suddenly taken away, and we have not yet found his successor; and now,
    Dr. Powell has been removed almost as suddenly, and we can scarcely hope to find one
    to take his place. Our only consolation is, that God makes no mistakes, and that,
    while men die, His work goes on.</p>
    <p>The death of Dr. Powell was unexpected, but its cause lay far back. When only
    nineteen years of age, he entered the service of the Christian Commission, and in the
    malarial regions of the South, the germs of disease were planted in his system. They
    were the cause of frequent and distressing turns of illness, while his irrepressible
    energy never allowed him to take the rest necessary for recovery. The physicians
    pronounced the immediate cause of his death to be apoplexy, but most men carrying his
    burden of ill-health would have yielded long before; only his immeasurable
    hopefulness and activity sustained him to the end.</p>
    <p>Rev. James Powell, D.D., was born in Wales, December 25, 1842. At an early age he
    came to this country, and partly by his own exertions and partly by the help of
    friends whom he had won to himself by his genial nature and evident indications of
    future usefulness, he obtained an education, graduating from Dartmouth College in
    1866, and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1869. He was installed as pastor of
    the church at Newburyport in November, 1869, his only pastorate, and remained there
    till February, 1873. His health being impaired by his incessant labors as pastor, he
    was persuaded by his friend, Rev. Mr. Pike, to aid in introducing the Jubilee Singers
    to the English public, with the further purpose of either remaining abroad to manage
    the affairs of the Singers in Great Britain, or of returning and temporarily taking
    Mr. Pike's place in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
    id="page30"></a>{30}</span> Connecticut and New York, as District Secretary of the
    Association. The latter alternative was finally decided upon, and Mr. Powell assumed
    these duties in the latter part of the year 1873. A year afterwards, on the
    resignation of Rev. Dr. Patton from our Chicago office, Mr. Powell, who had shown
    remarkable gifts as a speaker, was at once selected as District Secretary of our
    Western department. Here he remained for nearly ten years, when some changes were
    required in our district offices and he was called to New York as Assistant
    Corresponding Secretary, and entrusted with the supervision of the entire collecting
    field. The work he had done so acceptably and efficiently at the West was followed by
    equally effective services in his wider field at the East. In the three years of the
    recent burden of debt upon the Association, the energies of Dr. Powell were called
    into full play, and when, at our last Annual Meeting, we rejoiced in deliverance from
    debt, it was felt that the gratifying result was due in a large measure to his
    eloquence by voice and pen. At that meeting Dr. Powell was elected Corresponding
    Secretary of the Association.</p>
    <p>Bro. Powell was an orator born, not made. His eloquence was not of the Websterian
    sort, massive and logical, but rather of that magnetic kind which wins and sways an
    audience at will, sometimes to smiles and then to tears, but always with definite
    persuasion. He was a brilliant writer as well as speaker. His pen glowed with a
    special inspiration, and was prolific as well. The pages of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY,
    the columns of the weekly religious press, the numerous circulars issued from this
    office and his abundant correspondence, all bear witness to this. He was a wise man
    in counsel. The impassioned and imaginative speaker is not usually characterized by a
    cautious judgment or administrative gifts; but we have found in this office that when
    grave questions arose for consideration, Dr. Powell was remarkably conservative and
    judicious. But the crowning glory of the man was his bright and genial nature, and
    his warm and devoted Christian character. It was this that won all hearts, that made
    him welcome on every platform and in every pulpit, that bound his friends to him in
    warmest attachment, that opened the doors of all homes to him and that leaves the
    memory of brightness behind him in the offices where he toiled and in his own dear
    home. His life went out not as the lightning's flash, that leaves the deeper darkness
    behind, nor as the setting sun, that has the night before and after, but his
    departure from life was only the entrance into eternal brightness, and leaves a
    radiance behind that will be a perpetual joy and consolation to his friends. He was
    born on Christmas day, and the festivities of another Christmas day were not wholly
    past when he died. His birth was a Christmas gift to earth, and, be it said with
    reverence, his death was a Christmas gift to Heaven, for through the grace of our
    Lord Jesus Christ, and the sanctifying influence of the blessed spirit, we believe he
    was made meet to be presented to the Father, in whose hands we leave him.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
    <a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a>
    <h3>A WORD TO OUR WORKERS</h3>
    <p>To lead a people long crushed by oppression away from the degradations of slavery
    into a true and intelligent freedom, to teach those who have no inheritance of steady
    purpose to rise into new habits of thought and feeling, and away from the heredity of
    superstitions which were unrelated with morality, into a faith which really purifies
    the heart and the life, is not the work of a year, nor of fifty years. It means
    patient continuance in well doing. It means consecration, responsibility and
    self-sacrifice on the part of those who take upon themselves and into themselves, the
    sins and the sorrows, and the struggles and failures of those who are to be
    saved.</p>
    <p>Nothing but a consecration that becomes a passion of the soul in Christ's love and
    for Christ's sake, and an abiding faith in the triumph of his kingdom of love and
    righteousness, will explain the earnestness and labor of the devoted souls in our
    mission work, who are God's kings and priests ministering to the lowly, and crowding
    their days with service for those who have been the victims of the strong, and who,
    now weak and poor, are despised in their poverty and weakness.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>All honor to those who are giving themselves to break down the injustices of a
    cruel and unchristian caste, all honor to the noble men and women who are working to
    rescue millions from the woeful inheritance of centuries, as well as to save them from
    the dominion of the sin which is common to man.</p>
    <p>Others may honor Kings and Queens and Princes who have had their greatness thrust
    upon them, but we will stand with those who accentuate their reverence for lives
    consecrated to the good of humanity, who are afflicted with the sorrows of God's
    poor, and oppressed with their burdens, and whose prayers and songs are <i>God save
    the people</i>, Their lives may not be chronicled in the pages which tell of those
    who lived to make others serve them, but they are shining names upon God's Book of
    Life, and in the day of the coronation of the nobility which God sees and records,
    their names will stand out like radiant stars in the heavens. One of such was JAMES
    POWELL, whose life was a grand sacrifice of undeviating love for those whose
    necessities made him feel that he was debtor to them, until he gave them the price of
    his life which Christ had redeemed.</p>
    <p>Subordinating himself to this consecration with incessant desire, he has left his
    example which may well be inspiration and strength to all who are working and praying
    for those who have been trodden under the feet of the strong, and he has left his
    influence for tens of thousands.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In the prophecy which foretold Christ, centuries before he came it was written,
    "<i>He shall not fail, nor be discouraged</i>." Fellow workers, it is <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> not the consecration of
    a year, nor of a generation, that is to restore the millions for whom we work to the
    places where God would bring them. The pitiless centuries cannot be redeemed in one
    day. Doubtless the work may seem slow and the time may seem long, but every good deed
    counts, and no prayer is unheard. The good work is not in vain. The progress already
    made is wonderful. The workers who have consecrated themselves may die in their
    unfinished work, but God has pledged himself that the work shall go on. His promises
    and his providences will work together like cogs in a wheel. We shall not fail, and
    we need not be discouraged. Such lives as that of JAMES POWELL are not too common in
    human history, but they show us how the divine can endue the human with its own
    power, and how God can make souls great witnesses for God. Some tell us that the
    heroic ages have passed away, but they have not. No! They will last until the world
    shall be saved, for the inspirations which come from the spirit of God and from the
    cross of Christ will live in hearts which will burn to save those who need to be
    saved.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Since the death of Dr. Powell, we have received numerous letters from all parts of
    the country expressing sympathy in our great bereavement, which the writers shared
    profoundly with us. The admiration and love entertained by the writers, and uttered
    in these letters, toward our beloved brother, is gratifying to us, as it is also to
    his family. In the pressure of duties consequent upon his death and burial, we have
    not found time to reply to these letters, and take this occasion to acknowledge their
    receipt and to express our heartfelt thankfulness to the writers.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <p>We shall not be able to make the stirring appeals to provide for the exigent
    demands of our great work which our readers have been wont to recognize as coming
    from the heart of Dr. Powell, who had the oversight and burden of the collecting
    fields.</p>
    <p>Never was our work more critical, never more urgent and never more hopeful.</p>
    <p>The winter months, on which we must chiefly rely, are here, and are fast moving
    into the past. The work has been laid upon us and it would seem faithless to our
    sacred trust to sacrifice any part of it. But we must not take on a debt. We can only
    be saved from putting the knife to our work or of trying to do what we cannot pay
    for, if the faithful pastors of the churches will give their very present help. If
    the pastors who believe in the work, which includes the education and salvation of
    the needy among four races, will give their churches and Christian stewards a good
    chance to know how great the cause is and what its honest appeals are, we are
    confident that the Lord will deliver us from impending trouble.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span>
    <p>We will gladly furnish every pastor, and others who will send to us for them, such
    facts and figures as may be helpful in representing the work. Surely we can depend
    upon those who love God and their country for thoughtful remembrance and ready
    response.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The Rev. C.J. Ryder who has been assigned to the District Secretaryship of the
    Eastern district for the collecting field in New England, will, upon his return from
    a supervisory tour in the extreme South, succeed our friend, Dr. Woodworth, in the
    Boston office.</p>
    <p>It is well known to our readers that Superintendent Ryder, two and a half years
    ago, was induced to assume the laborious work then demitted by Rev. Dr. Roy upon a
    similar transfer of Dr. Roy from the Field Superintendency to the District
    Secretaryship of the West, with his office in Chicago. To those who have read the
    "Notes in the Saddle" from the South, in our magazine, written by Supt. Ryder, we
    need add no word of introduction. Nor need we say that he will carry into his new
    department of our common work the same energy, zeal and interest which has
    characterized the past. With his presentations of the work, and with his personal
    knowledge and experience of the field, and of every part of it, we anticipate for the
    new District Secretary a hearty welcome and co-operation on the part of our pastors
    and churches. The work in the South will be temporarily supervised, and arrangements
    have been made for this by the New York office.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In retiring from his long-time trust, the Rev. Dr. Woodworth bears with him the
    thanks of multitudes of God's poor in the South, and the high regard of all who have
    been associated in co-operative work with him. It is not impossible that he may yet
    see his way to add to his record of many years, still further service in another
    department of this varied work.</p>

    <h3>DEATH OF REV. WM. H. ELLIS.</h3>
    <p>Rev. William H. Ellis died Nov. 28th, at Troy, N.C., aged thirty-five years and
    six months. He entered the work of the A.M.A. in North Carolina in 1878 and continued
    in that field. At the time of his death he was pastor of the Congregational Church
    and teacher of the Association's school, at Troy, N.C. He was a graduate of Williams
    College and continued his habits of study during the years of his arduous labor as a
    missionary.</p>
    <p>He had been for a long time in feeble health, but was unwilling to leave his post
    of duty even temporarily to secure his recovery. His services in this field of the
    A.M.A. have been characterized by self-denial, patience and faithfulness. He was
    intensely loyal to his convictions and died having fought the good fight, a Christian
    hero.</p>

    <h3>THE SOUTH.</h3>
    <h4>NOTES IN THE SADDLE</h4>
    <p class="author">BY FIELD-SUPERINTENDENT C.J. RYDER.</p>
    <p>I write these notes under the shadow of the great affliction that has fallen upon
    the A.M.A. in the death of Dr. Powell. Although he was at the head of another
    department of A.M.A. work, we always knew that we had in him a kind and thoughtful
    friend, and one who would cordially co-operate with the other officers in their
    far-reaching plans for the development of the work, even though it added to his cares
    and burdens in gathering the funds necessary to carry out these plans. We who have
    our work and responsibilities in the field, no less than those who were in <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span> the office with Dr.
    Powell, would bear our tribute of love, and scatter the blossoms of holy memories
    upon this new-made grave.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Two State Associations of unusual interest were held during the month of November.
    The Central South Association met with the Trinity Church, in Athens, Ala., Nov. 3d.
    This Association includes the churches of Tennessee and two or three of those in
    Alabama. The reports from the churches were very complete. Only one church in the
    Association was without regular ministerial services, and that church had recently
    lost its pastor by death. They are now supplied by a competent and faithful minister.
    The temperance question was discussed with great enthusiasm. The influence of Fisk
    University on the right side, during the recent prohibition battle in Tennessee, can
    scarcely be over-estimated. Many expressed the judgment that the argument of the
    Southern whites, that the colored people defeated prohibition, was not true. One
    pastor reported that his county went almost solidly against prohibition, and there
    was only one colored man in the county, so far as he knew, and he was a staunch
    prohibitionist. Some argued that while so many churches and Women's Christian
    Temperance Unions and Young Men's Christian Associations shut out respectable colored
    people, and saloons welcomed those who were not respectable, it would be a difficult
    task for the better class to induce the more ignorant to vote against those who
    welcomed them and in favor of those who shut them out. Is there not considerable
    force in their arguments?</p>
    <p>A young colored man, who had been a preacher in one of the old churches of the
    South and had become disgusted with its ignorance, superstition and immorality,
    presented his credentials and applied for admission into the Congregational
    Association of the State. This action of his is a straw which shows which way the
    wind of religious thought blows among the intelligent colored people of the South.
    The weather-vane points toward Congregationalism. An aged pastor, who had endured
    ostracism and violence in New York State in the early times, on account of his
    anti-slavery opinions, was present during the meetings of the Association, and added
    greatly to their interest. It was a thrilling sight to him to look upon these colored
    brethren during their earnest and often eloquent discussions, and to remember how
    much he had suffered in their behalf in other days. Trinity School opened its doors
    wide and offered generous hospitality to the pastors and delegates. On the whole, it
    was one of the best meetings the Association has ever enjoyed.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The Congregational Association of the State of Georgia met with the church at
    Macon, November 9th-14th. The church and its new pastor, a son of Connecticut, did
    their utmost to make the meetings pleasant and helpful. The band of earnest Christian
    teachers of Lewis Normal Institute, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
    id="page45"></a>{45}</span> the A.M.A. school at Macon, joined hands with the church
    and pastor in helping to make the sessions of the Association profitable. Here, too,
    as in the Central South Association, the temperance question held a prominent place
    in the discussions. There was not a member of the Association but was heartily in
    favor of prohibition. The Atlanta campaign was on in all its heat and passion, and
    beseeching requests were made by the delegates from that city that prayer might be
    offered for them as they passed through the heat of this battle against legalizing
    crime. Almost every church in the Association was represented in this meeting and one
    new church applied for admission. This church stands near the old prison pen of
    Andersonville and so the blood of the martyrs proves the seed of the church, whether
    they wear the monk's cowl of a Huss or the ragged blue of our country. The church at
    Charleston, S.C., reported two missions just established in the destitute parts of
    that city. All the churches in this Association assisted by the A.M.A. are struggling
    towards self-support under helpful pressure from that Society. I am glad to report
    that the church at Savannah has taken upon itself the support of its pastor and local
    expenses for the next year. The churches in this Association, although poor and often
    in serious financial straits themselves, showed their appreciation of other lines of
    Christian work by passing the following resolution:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Resolved,</i> That in view of the financial embarrassments of the Home
      Missionary Society, the pastors of the churches urge upon their people the duty of
      taking up a collection for the benefit of that Society.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <p>As illustrating the need of intelligent and decent church services in the South, I
    record the following facts, which were related to me by those who knew of them
    personally. A colored preacher of the "old-time" sort preached on the Judgment Day.
    He held the meeting from evening till well into the night. He arranged with a
    worthless fellow to hide himself in the woods just outside the church, with a
    tremendously big dinner-horn, with instructions to blow upon it at a certain signal.
    At the awful hour of midnight, when, by entreaty and appeal and frightful figures of
    speech, the preacher had worked the people up into a frenzy of excitement and terror,
    he exclaimed, "Listen, I reckon I hear Gabriel getting ready to blow now. De last day
    am on us, de judgment am right here, whar you sinners now? Listen." And with bated
    breath they listened. Just then there came a fearful blast on the stillness of the
    midnight air, and the scene that followed can better be imagined than described.
    Helter-skelter over the benches and over each other, the terrified people scrambled
    for the mourners' bench. The preacher boastfully told afterward, that "dar want
    scarsely one sinner but what wah effected."</p>
    <p>The quiet forms of worship in our Congregational churches, and the intelligent
    preaching of the A.M.A. ministers, are fast bringing about a <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span> state of things which will drive out such
    church circuses, with their ministerial clowns. God speed the day!</p>
    <hr />
    <p>During a considerable portion of the last month I have been "riding double," as
    our honored Secretary, Dr. Beard, has been in the saddle with me. His knowledge of
    the field, gained through these frequent personal visits, is of great advantage to
    the work and highly appreciated by the workers. We jogged together over many miles of
    country, comparing notes, discussing plans and expressing our mutual surprise at the
    wonderful and far-reaching work which is being accomplished, and the prophetic
    glories of the future.</p>
    <p>An account of the mountain campaign, through which Secretary Beard went with me,
    will be the subject of future notes.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The following churches have been organized in our Southern field during the past
    few weeks:</p>
    <p>Deer Lodge Congregational Church, Deer Lodge, Tenn., organized Nov. 16, 1887, with
    thirteen members; Calvary Congregational Church, Pine Mountain, Tenn., organized Nov.
    26, 1887, with thirteen members; Second Congregational Church, Decatur, Ala.,
    organized Nov. 30, 1887, with fifteen members.</p>

    <h3>THE INDIANS.</h3>
    <h4>WHAT AN INDIAN THINKS OF IT.</h4>
    <p>The writer of this letter is Loafer Redhorse, a son-in-law of the Titon Chief,
    Swift Bear, whose band have colonized as homesteaders along the Niobrara River near
    the mouth of Keya Paha River. Their colony is one hundred and thirty miles from
    Rosebud Agency, to which they belong. Their settlement we call Burrell Station in
    honor of Dea. Burrell, of Oberlin, Ohio, who gave the money to build the school-house
    and home for the teacher. Mr. Francis Frazier, son of Pastor Ehnamani of Santee, has
    now been their teacher two years.</p>
    <p>Loafer Redhorse is anything but a loafer. He is one of the most industrious men.
    He is one who would naturally be first in war, as he says, and now also is first in
    following the plow, and learning the ways of the white man. Among other things it is
    interesting to know what he thinks of prohibiting the use of the Dakota language.</p>
    <p>MY FRIENDS: Let me speak now. I am sad because of one thing which I will now speak
    of. Since our school-house (the Burrell station school) was built, I, with my
    children, have attended with a glad heart just as if it were my own. And now I hear
    that it is likely to be closed, and I will speak about that. And this is why I have
    something to say. The scholars <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
    id="page47"></a>{47}</span> who go out from the Brules to go to school, come back
    without knowing anything, for the reason that they don't teach them anything except
    to work. That is the reason they don't know anything, I think.</p>
    <p>And I will tell how it was with us under Indian customs since the time I had
    understanding. Then the Indian tribes were happy. Into whatever country was good they
    roamed just as they pleased. At that time, although there were many Indians on all
    sides, there was a great country in between full of buffalo. It seemed to be the
    buffalo's country. And the Indian people were made happy because of the buffalo. The
    people would move their camps and pitch their tents again and the buffalo would come
    right in among their tents with a great noise. Then it was that the people had great
    joy.</p>
    <p>And there was another thing that the people rejoiced in greatly. I will speak of
    that also. That was in war. When they went to war and came near the enemies'
    dwellings and saw the enemy there they would choose out about ten of the bravest
    young men and dispatch them to kill some of the enemy. Then they would draw near to
    the houses, and soon though there might be five whose hearts were not able for it,
    the others would go on and kill a man at his house. And the great joy that I spoke of
    was thus: of the five who had killed an enemy but only four of them could take the
    glory, but their names would be praised throughout the whole Indian nation; they
    would be glorified and considered as chiefs. But most of all, he who first killed the
    enemy he would be the chief. And then when they had returned home even the women
    would rejoice greatly. They would dance night and day, all of them. And as I, myself,
    was chief, I considered this the very greatest joy. Such were our customs.</p>
    <p>But now from the place I now occupy, I look back and remember these things. And
    though the Indian people had all of these customs, I know not one of them that made
    the people prosper or brought life to them. I have not seen that brought life to the
    people. And thus from where I am now, I am always looking to the future. On this
    account I am looking forward. The Indians have been told the words of the
    Grandfather, (the President). And they tell us that by these words the people will
    prosper.</p>
    <p>"Plant; by that you shall live," the Grandfather told them. And now I know a
    little that the Grandfather spoke the truth. The Grandfather gives me food for six
    days, but even though I eat a very little each day, in three days I have eaten it all
    up. But now I have raised corn and though I abide here eating nothing else, by it I
    live. And also to go from my place to where the Grandfather gives me rations takes
    one week to go and the same to come back and I stay over a few days to rest when
    there, and so it altogether covers over three weeks or more. Therefore, though I have
    settled here and desire to busy myself in all the white man's ways that I am able, I
    have not yet become independent. And therefore, I earnestly wish, if it were
    possible, that the Grandfather would enable us to receive <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page48" id="page48"></a>{48}</span> a year's rations at a time, and then we
    would make speedy progress in the white man's way.</p>
    <p>And because of this also, the children do not advance much in their learning. For
    when we go after the food they also go along. If they should stay behind, food is
    scarce, therefore they go along.</p>
    <p>And now I hear it said that schooling in the Dakota language is to be altogether
    stopped, and on this account I am sad. For in the school-house here they learn well
    and also they pray. It is because they do these things in the Dakota language that we
    have been brought to understand them and to love them, and gladly live in accordance
    with them. Then also if it was all done (the teaching and praying) by a white man we
    would understand nothing about it, and so I do not think it would be well.</p>
    <p>And now this is the last thing I want to say. The Grandfather has for his own the
    Indians all over the land, and he always helps them according to what may be for
    their welfare. Now he is measuring off the land for them, but I hear it said that he
    measures it very, very small, and I am sad about that. If only he would have mercy
    and measure it off for them largely, that is what I think. A good while ago the
    Grandfather made a treaty with the Indians and promised to give them three hundred
    and twenty acres, and according to that I have chosen my homestead and that suits me.
    Therefore I prize the Grandfather's word and measure myself by it. And thus I possess
    myself and my children.</p>
    <p>Although we are not many people here, yet I always command them to give heed to
    the words of the Grandfather. And I bear witness to their constant attendance at the
    house (the school and church) that stands here. Although I am wholly an Indian, yet
    these are my judgments and so I tell them. And I write them in order that some may
    think about the Indians. My friends, I wish you to hear these words and so I write
    them. I shake hands with a good heart.</p>

    <p>Miss Bertha Robertson, missionary of the A.M.A. from McIntosh, Ga., will spend a
    few months in presenting our work in the North. She has just completed a missionary
    tour in Maine, which has been most fruitful of good, and will now give a few weeks to
    the churches of New Hampshire, speaking to meetings of ladies, or to mixed audiences,
    as may be desired. Applications for her services can be made to Miss Emerson, of the
    Woman's Bureau, 56 Reade St., New York, or to Rev. Cyrus Richardson, Nashua, N.
    H.</p>
    <p>A teacher in the South writes:&mdash;"We have had a Merry Christmas trying to make
    others happy. The people have never done so much for others before. We found an old
    couple in very destitute circumstances, and asked the school children if they would
    not like to do something for them. It was very interesting to see them bring their
    gifts of a little sugar, meal, flour, or an armful of wood, a potato, a little salt,
    whatever they could get. It did them good. After our Christmas exercises at the
    church, we took quite a number of the children around to see the old people, and they
    sang their Christmas songs. I don't know which enjoyed it most, the children or the
    old people.</p>
    <p>Some young men of the Sunday-school paid a month's rent for a poor woman. We are
    doing more than ever this year in getting the young people to go and hold prayer
    meetings, or read to those who cannot get out to church."</p>

    <h4>HOW SUSY WENT TO TOUGALOO.</h4>
    <p>You never could guess just how she went, if you should try from now until your
    next birthday, so I'll tell you first how she came to go to Tougaloo at all.</p>
    <p>To begin with, Mamma Bradley had been rummaging about in the attic a long time,
    when little Fay set out to find her.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing up here, mamma?" said Fay. "I've been hunting for you ever so
    long."</p>
    <p>"Oh, I'm looking for some things to put in the barrel that is going to Tougaloo
    for the poor people that the missionaries are working for."</p>
    <p>"Clothes?" said Fay.</p>
    <p>"Yes, clothes, and I suppose they would be glad of almost anything that would help
    to make their lives more comfortable," said her mother.</p>
    <p>Fay sat down in an old basket and watched her mother fold and unfold the contents
    of trunks and boxes so quietly, that Mrs. Bradley finally looked up and said:</p>
    <p>"Why don't you go to your play, dear? What are you thinking about?"</p>
    <p>"I was thinking," said Fay, "do you s'pose the Tougaloo folks have any little
    girls?"</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span>
    <p>"Oh, yes, plenty of them."</p>
    <p>"Big's me?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, all sizes, I suppose," said Mrs. Bradley, going on with her work.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Fay, "I was thinking, how d'you s'pose they'd like Susy?"</p>
    <p>"What! the new dolly that Auntie gave you for keeping your elbows off the
    table?"</p>
    <p>"Yes'm," said Fay. "Do you s'pose she'd make a little Tougaloo girl's life any
    more comfor'ble?"</p>
    <p>"Why, yes, dear, anything that gives you so much pleasure would please them, of
    course," said her mother, "but are you quite sure you want to give Susy away?"</p>
    <p>"Well, when Auntie gave us our missionary boxes in the Sunday-school class, she
    told us to be sure and remember what was printed on them, and she read on one side
    something about people giving their first fruits, and she said it meant their best
    things, and on top it said, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
    these, ye have done it unto me.' Now Susy is my best doll&mdash;any way I love her
    best, and there couldn't be anybody much leaster than a little girl like me way down
    in Tougaloo, could there, mamma?"</p>
    <p>"Well, you must think it all over, and if you are quite sure that you want to do
    it, we will take Susy down to the church this afternoon with the other things," said
    her mother.</p>
    <p>Fay said no more, and in a few minutes she tripped down stairs, and when her mamma
    followed soon after, she heard the creak of Fay's little rocking chair, and the
    words, "Sleep, baby, sleep," which told her as she peeped through a crack in the
    door, that Susy was getting her last lullaby from the fond little mother, who at the
    proper time presented Susy all dressed for her journey to Tougaloo.</p>
    <p>"When Fay and her mother arrived at the church, sure enough right there in the
    parlor stood two or three barrels, while dear old Mrs. Rogers and half a dozen other
    ladies were filling them with useful articles.</p>
    <p>"Here is a package of clothing," said Mrs. Bradley, " and I have another bundle,
    which Dennis will bring from the carriage in a few minutes."</p>
    <p>"And Susy's going to Tougaloo," said Fay, reaching out her treasure to Grandma
    Rogers as she spoke.</p>
    <p>"Well now, the dear," said Grandma Rogers, "don't you want her yourself,
    blossom?"</p>
    <p>"No'm, not now," said Fay, "if you'll find a little girl who'll take real good
    care of her&mdash;her name's ' Susy.'"</p>
    <p>"Well, did you ever!" said Grandma Rogers. " Here's jest the place for Susy, she
    can set right here in Miss Blout's bunnit as snug as a bug."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute, Mrs. Rogers," said Miss Bliss, and taking a pencil she wrote on a
    little slip of paper, "My name is Susy, and I should like to go to some little girl
    who will take good care of me." This she read and pinned the slip on Susy's pretty
    dress when she was safely seated in "Miss Blout's bunnit," in which odd carriage,
    made of roses and ribbons, Susy started on her long journey to Tougaloo. Her little
    mother, Fay, would like some day to get a letter from Susy's new mother, though she
    has not yet heard from her.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
